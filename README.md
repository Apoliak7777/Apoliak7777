# 👋 Hi, I'm **Apoliak**

Web‑focused developer who likes starting lean, iterating fast, and keeping code understandable. I enjoy crafting clean interfaces, structured layouts, and gradually layering in logic (rather than over‑engineering on day one).

## 📌 Quick Summary
- I like: simple HTML/CSS structure first → enhancing with JS / PHP only when needed.
- Philosophy: Make it work → make it clear → make it fast.
- Learning Path: modular JavaScript, better backend structure, deployment workflows.
- Collaboration: I maintain my own projects and contribute via structured forks (e.g. Lorelei site).

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Growing)
Core: HTML, CSS (responsive layouts, utility patterns)  
Learning / Using: JavaScript (modular scripts), PHP (basic server rendering)  
Tools & Workflow: Git, GitHub (fork + PR flow), lightweight local servers  
Planned Exploration: API design (REST), minimal backend containerization (Docker basics), accessibility improvements

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Refining consistent layout system (spacing, component blocks)
- Abstracting project data instead of hardcoding repeated sections
- Introducing a simple plan config for Hosting_Website
- Improving modular includes in PHP portfolio (header/footer reuse)
- Establishing a README pattern template for every new repo
- Practicing clean commit messages and branching discipline

---

## 🧪 Workflow Style
1. Plan minimal slice (layout skeleton / basic sections)  
2. Commit early; keep change sets small  
3. Iterate UI clarity (naming, file structure)  
4. Only introduce JS when interaction value > complexity  
5. Document intention (why) in PR or commit message  

Suggested commit prefixes I use / plan to standardize:  
feat: new feature section  
style: layout / spacing / visual polish  
refactor: reorganize without changing behavior  
docs: README / comments  
chore: maintenance tasks

## 🔮 Future Ideas / Roadmap (General)
- Lightweight JSON-driven project listing (for portfolio)
- Simple task management logic (local storage → optional backend later)
- Add dark/light theme toggle (prefers-color-scheme + switch)
- Accessibility pass (landmarks, aria labels, contrast test)
- Switch to partial build system (maybe a static site generator later)
- Basic deploy script or GitHub Actions for portfolio updates

---

## 🤝 Collaboration & Contributions
I welcome:
- Suggestions on code organization
- Accessibility or performance tips
- Minimalistic improvement ideas

Process:
1. Fork or create a feature branch  
2. Keep the scope tight (one concern per PR)  
3. Explain intent — what changed & why  
4. I review / iterate / merge (or upstream if fork context)
